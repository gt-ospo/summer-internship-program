# GT OSPO Summer Internship Program

Starting in 2024, the GT Open Source Program Office (OSPO) ran a new Virtual Summer Internship Program for students to participate in various open-source projects during the summer session. During this virtual internship, students joined an open source project, worked with the developers and maintainers of that project to make contributions to the code base, and learned useful software development and engineering skills to engage with the wider open-source community. 

## 2025 Updates

We are starting the next cycle for the 2025 Summer Internship, running from May 19th to July 31st. Please see our [2025 page](https://ospo.cc.gatech.edu/vsip-2025/) and the [informational session agenda](https://github.com/gt-ospo/summer-internship-program/blob/main/2025/information_session_agenda.md).

## 2024 Updates
The 2024 Summer Internship Program is now complete, and we're excited to share some of the key outputs from our students: 

* Each student team [presented a poster on their experiences as well as a short lightning talk](https://github.com/gt-ospo/summer-internship-program/blob/main/2024/student_final_poster_presentations.md) sharing what they learned about contributing to open source projects.
* Many students also wrote blog posts about their summer internship experience, and we've collected and shared those [at this link](https://github.com/gt-ospo/summer-internship-program/blob/main/2024/student_blog_posts.md).
* You can find the wrap-up article for the program at [this link](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/open-source-office-wraps-inaugural-internship-program).
